Ryan Bates Dot Files

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.


Installation

  git clone git://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  rake install
  # edit ~/.gitconfig and personalize it


Environment

I am running on Mac OS X, but it will likely work on Linux as well with 
minor fiddling. I primarily use zsh, but this includes some older bash 
files as well. If you would like to switch to zsh, you can do so with 
the following command.

  chsh -s /bin/zsh


Features

I normally place all of my coding projects in ~/code, so this directory 
can easily be accessed (and tab completed) with the "c" command.

  c railsca<tab>

Tab completion is also added to rake and cap commands:

  rake db:mi<tab>
  cap de<tab>

To speed things up, the results are cached in local .rake_tasks~ and 
.cap_tasks~. It is smart enough to expire the cache automatically in 
most cases, but you can simply remove the files to flush the cache.

If you're using git, you'll notice the current branch name shows up in
the prompt while in a git repository.

If you're using Rails, you'll find some handy aliases (below). You can 
also use show_log and hide_log in script/console to show the log inline.
  
  ss       # script/server
  sc       # script/console
  migrate  # rake db:migrate db:test:clone
  scaffold # script/generate migration nifty_scaffold
